# CONKart
CONKart is an Inventory Management System project that helps businesses and organizations efficiently track and manage their inventory. It is developed using Java with the Swing framework and utilizes SQL\*Plus for the database.

## Project Overview
The CONKart Inventory Management System consists of a database to store all inventory-related information. The system allows you to manage products, suppliers, customers, orders, and inventory details.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the CONKart project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have NetBeans IDE installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official website: NetBeans.
2. Install SQL\*Plus, which is an Oracle database management tool. You can download it from the Oracle website: Oracle Database Express Edition.
3. Create the necessary tables in the database by running the creat_tables.sql script in SQL\*Plus. This script will create the required tables and define their structure.
4. Download the CONKart project files and open them in NetBeans.
5. Add jcalendar-1.4.jar in the libraries of the project.

## Unique feature
CONKart's unique feature is scheduled ordering, which automates the inventory replenishment process based on predefined schedules. 
This helps businesses maintain a continuous supply of products, optimize inventory levels, and save time and effort.
